PongProject
===========
- The code for MyDirectX.h, MyDirectX.cpp, and MyWindows.cpp are primarily derived from exercises from the book Beginning Game Programming by Jonathan S. Harbour. Additional work to be done will include reworking the code to turn it into something closer to what I would call my own.
- If you have come here looking to provide feedback on the code, please keep in mind that the files noted above are not entirely my code and I'm primarily looking for feedback on the other files. However, I'm grateful for any feedback provided by anybody really.

KNOWN ISSUES
- There is an edge case where on the corner of the paddles the ball will collide with the paddle more than once before traveling away from the paddle.
- There is an edge case where the AI paddle will trap the ball in its corner.
