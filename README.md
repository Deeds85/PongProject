PongProject
===========
- The code for MyDirectX.h, MyDirectX.cpp, and MyWindows.cpp are primarily derived from exercises from the book Beginning Game Programming by Jonathan S. Harbour. Additional work to be done will include reworking the code to turn it into something closer to what I would call my own.
- If you have come here looking to provide feedback on the code, please keep in mind that the files noted above are not entirely my code and I'm primarily looking for feedback on the other files. However, I'm grateful for any feedback provided by anybody really.

KNOWN ISSUES
- There is some funniness when the ball makes contact with the corners of the paddles.
